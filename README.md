# good-news-only
A small pet project made in teamwork with  [Ekaterina Barsukova](https://github.com/alterkate) and [Ivan Merkulov](https://github.com/ivan8597).
The essence of the project is to download news from a third-party resource, upload it to the database, and then sort it by words with exceptions and display it by request.
